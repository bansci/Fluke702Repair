# Fluke702Repair
The notes I took while repairing a Fluke 702. The accompanying YouTube video is here:

There's a KICAD file (in the zip) for the frontend amplifier of the 702 which roughly sketches the layout of the key components.

There's also a XCF image file (open in GIMP) that has two layers, the front and back of the PCB, overlayed fairly precisely to let you trace connections from one side to another.
